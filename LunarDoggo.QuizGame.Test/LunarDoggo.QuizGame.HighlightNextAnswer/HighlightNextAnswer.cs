   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: Highlighting the next answer with multiple answers available

Details:
  TestName: HighlightNextAnswerWithMultipleAnswers
  Description: Tests if the method correctly moves to the next answer when multiple answers are available for the current question.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a GameState instance with a current question having multiple answers. Set the highlighted answer index to a middle value.
  Act: Invoke the HighlightNextAnswer method.
  Assert: Check if the highlighted answer index increments by 1.
Validation:
  The assertion checks whether the highlighted answer index is correctly incremented. It is significant for maintaining correct navigation through the answer options, enhancing user experience and ensuring functional accuracy in the quiz navigation.

Scenario 2: Edge case for the last answer in the list

Details:
  TestName: HighlightNextAnswerAtEndOfList
  Description: Assesses if the method loops back to the first answer after the last option has been highlighted.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a GameState with a current question that has multiple answers, and set the highlighted answer index to the last possible index.
  Act: Call HighlightNextAnswer.
  Assert: Assert that the highlighted answer index is reset to zero.
Validation:
  This test verifies the circular navigation functionality, ensuring that the users can cycle through answers continuously without interruptions, which is critical for the user interface in quiz applications.

Scenario 3: No current question is set

Details:
  TestName: HighlightNextAnswerWithNoCurrentQuestion
  Description: Checks how the method behaves if there is no current question selected.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a GameState without setting a current question.
  Act: Execute the HighlightNextAnswer method.
  Assert: No change should occur; assertions may depend on how method is designed to handle this scenario.
Validation:
  Ensures robustness of the application by handling cases where operations are attempted without requisite conditions being met. This helps prevent crashes and unexpected behavior in the app.

Scenario 4: Single answer cyclic behavior check

Details:
  TestName: HighlightNextAnswerWithSingleAnswer
  Description: Verifies whether the highlighting of answers correctly handles the scenario where only one answer is present.
Execution:
  Arrange: Establish a GameState with a current question that contains only one answer and set the highlighted answer index to zero.
  Act: Invoke HighlightNextAnswer multiple times.
  Assert: The highlighted answer index stays at zero regardless of the number of method invocations.
Validation:
  Checks the application's resilience in scenarios with minimal data, confirming that functionality remains accurate and predictable even in seemingly trivial circumstances.

Scenario 5: Sequence with HighlightNextAnswer followed by HighlightPreviousAnswer

Details:
  TestName: HighlightNextAndPreviousAnswerSequence
  Description: Tests the system's consistency and accuracy in tracking highlighted answer indices when alternating between highlighting next and previous answers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Configure a GameState with a current question having multiple answers, set a non-zero highlighted answer index.
  Act: Call HighlightNextAnswer then immediately call HighlightPreviousAnswer.
  Assert: The final highlighted answer index should be same as the initial.
Validation:
  This test ensures the application can accurately track answer highlighting across user interactions, crucial for maintaining state consistency within the user session.
