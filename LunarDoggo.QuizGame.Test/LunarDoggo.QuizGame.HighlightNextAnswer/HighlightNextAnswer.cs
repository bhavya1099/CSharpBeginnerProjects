   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: Highlight Single Answer in a List

Details:
  TestName: HighlightNextAnswerWithSingleAnswerQuestion
  Description: This test will verify that the `HighlightNextAnswer` method correctly cycles back to the first answer when there is only one answer for a question and the method is invoked.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a GameState with one question that contains only one answer. The highlighted answer index should initially be at this single answer.
  Act: Call the `HighlightNextAnswer` method.
  Assert: Check that the highlighted answer index is still pointing to the only available answer.
Validation:
  Clarify that the highlighted answer index should remain unchanged as cycling through a single answer should lead back to itself. This ensures that `HighlightNextAnswer` correctly handles questions with minimal options.

Scenario 2: Highlighting Answers Rolls Over Correctly

Details:
  TestName: HighlightNextAnswerWithMultipleAnswersRollsOver
  Description: Evaluate whether the `HighlightNextAnswer` method correctly rolls over to the first answer after reaching the last answer in the list.
Execution:
  Arrange: Setup GameState with a question that has multiple answers. Set the highlighted answer index to the last answer initially.
  Act: Invoke the `HighlightNextAnswer` method.
  Assert: Assert that the highlighted answer index is reset to zero, pointing to the first answer.
Validation:
  Validate that cycling past the last answer correctly resets to the first, ensuring that the answer highlighting loops properly in a circular manner.

Scenario 3: Current Question Is Null

Details:
  TestName: HighlightNextAnswerWhenCurrentQuestionIsNull
  Description: Test the system behavior when the `HighlightNextAnswer` method is called but the current question is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Configure GameState such that `CurrentQuestion` is null.
  Act: Call the `HighlightNextAnswer` method.
  Assert: No change in the interface state or exceptions should occur.
Validation:
  Ensuring safety in the event that there is no current question set, thus preventing any null reference exceptions when trying to access properties of `CurrentQuestion`.

Scenario 4: Valid Answer Cycling with Multiple Answers

Details:
  TestName: ValidHighlightNextAnswerOnTypicalFlow
  Description: Test to ascertain that `HighlightNextAnswer` correctly changes the highlighted index under typical conditions with multiple answers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a `GameState`, set a question with multiple answers and a non-border index as the highlighted answer.
  Act: Call the `HighlightNextAnswer` method.
  Assert: Assert that the `highlightedAnswerIndex` is incremented by one.
Validation:
  Confirm that each call to `HighlightNextAnswer` results in moving the highlighted index correctly, hence simulating the realistic scenario of a user navigating through possible answers of a question using a UI control.

Scenario 5: Answer Highlight Wraps Around in Large Sets of Answers

Details:
  TestName: HighlightNextAnswerWrapsAroundWithLargeAnswerSet
  Description: Verify the functionality when `HighlightNextAnswer` is used on a large set of answers, focusing on the end-to-start wrap-around.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create GameState with a question containing many answers. Set the `highlightedAnswerIndex` to the last index.
  Act: Invoke `HighlightNextAnswer`.
  Assert: The highlighted answer index should wrap around to zero.
Validation:
  Validate that the method handles large lists and correctly rolls over, which is crucial for usability ensuring that the answer navigation is intuitive and seamless, regardless of the number of answers.
