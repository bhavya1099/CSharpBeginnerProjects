   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: Validate Console Output When DrawNoQuestions Is Called

Details:
  TestName: VerifyCorrectMessageWhenNoQuestionsAreLoaded
  Description: This test checks if the correct message is displayed in the console when there are no questions loaded, and verifies the prompt for reloading the game.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a redirect of the console output to capture the output stream.
  Act: Call the DrawNoQuestions method.
  Assert: Capture the console output and assert that it contains the expected message "No questions were loaded, please enter some questions into the json file in the applications folder.\n\nReload game? (Y/N)".
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the output message is exactly as specified, ensuring that users are appropriately informed about the error and given instructions on what to do next. It confirms the behavior of DrawNoQuestions method under scenarios with no data, which is crucial for user guidance and error handling.

Scenario 2: Validate Console Handling With No Interference From Other Outputs

Details:
  TestName: ConsoleOutputIsolationForDrawNoQuestions
  Description: Checks to ensure that calling DrawNoQuestions does not interfere with other console outputs by maintaining clear isolation. This is critical in ensuring clear and understandable user prompts.
Execution:
  Arrange: Redirect console output and invoke another method that outputs to the console, capturing both outputs separately.
  Act: Call the DrawNoQuestions method after the prior console output.
  Assert: Assert that the output of DrawNoQuestions is independent and contains only its expected message without any additional content.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the DrawNoQuestions method behaves as expected without depending on or altering the state from previous console interactions, which is significant for maintaining clear user communication pathways during runtime operations.

Scenario 3: Validate Behavior With Multiple Sequential Calls

Details:
  TestName: ConsistentOutputOnMultipleInvocations
  Description: Validates that multiple sequential calls to DrawNoQuestions consistently produce the same output, which simulates a scenario where the game repeatedly reaches the same error state without alteration of external conditions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Redirect console output and call DrawNoQuestions multiple times.
  Act: Call the DrawNoQuestions method repeatedly, for example, three times.
  Assert: Assert each output is identical and matches the expected message.
Validation:
  Ensuring consistent outputs verifies that the method doesn't exhibit stateful behavior or unintended side effects from repeated calls. Consistency in error messages is key to reliable user interaction mechanisms.

Scenario 4: Test Console State Restoration After Execution

Details:
  TestName: EnsureConsoleStateIsRestoredPostMethodExecution
  Description: This test ensures that any changes made to the console's properties within the DrawNoQuestions are reverted back upon completion. This is essential for maintaining application-wide consistency in console behavior.
Execution:
  Arrange: Record initial console state (e.g., cursor visibility), and redirect console output.
  Act: Call the DrawNoQuestions method.
  Assert: Assert that all modified states are returned to their initial settings after the method execution.
Validation:
  This test discerns that the DrawNoQuestions method adheres to good practice by not permanently altering console state, which might affect other parts of the application negatively. It confirms the method's safe integration into applications by not having side effects on global console properties.
