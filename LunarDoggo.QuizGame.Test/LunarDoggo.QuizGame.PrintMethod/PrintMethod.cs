   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: Verify PrintMethod Output

Details:
  TestName: TestPrintMethodOutputsCorrectString
  Description: Test to verify that the static method PrintMethod in the Newclass outputs the expected string to the console.
Execution:
  Arrange: Redirect standard output stream to capture console output.
  Act: Call Newclass.PrintMethod() to execute.
  Assert: Check if the captured output matches "jst in case".
Validation:
  This test verifies that PrintMethod correctly writes the expected string to the console, essential for validating side effects of console-based methods.

Scenario 2: Verify Console Method Call

Details:
  TestName: TestPrintMethodCallsConsoleWriteLine
  Description: Ensure that the Console.WriteLine method is being called correctly within PrintMethod.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the console to confirm method invocation.
  Act: Invoke Newclass.PrintMethod().
  Assert: Assert that Console.WriteLine was called exactly once with the string "jst in case".
Validation:
  Validates that the dependency of PrintMethod on Console.WriteLine is correctly implemented and there are no deviations in calling external methods, which is crucial for traceability and maintainability of the code.

Scenario 3: Verify Console Output Formatting

Details:
  TestName: TestPrintMethodOutputFormatting
  Description: Ensure that the output from PrintMethod includes no leading or trailing whitespace characters and other formatting issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: Redirect the standard output stream and capture console output.
  Act: Call Newclass.PrintMethod().
  Assert: Ensure the output is exactly "jst in case" with no additional formatting.
Validation:
  This test checks the integrity of the output format. It is important as it ensures that no unintended characters or spaces are included in the output, which could lead to display issues or errors in downstream processes.

Scenario 4: Test PrintMethod During Multiple Executions

Details:
  TestName: TestPrintMethodConsistentOutputOnMultipleCalls
  Description: Test to ensure that multiple consecutive calls to PrintMethod always produce consistent and correct output.
Execution:
  Arrange: Redirect console output, setup loop for multiple executions.
  Act: Execute PrintMethod multiple times in a loop.
  Assert: Check each output for consistency and correctness.
Validation:
  This test ensures reliability and stability of the PrintMethod output across multiple invocations, which is crucial in scenarios where repetitive or batch operations are performed.

Scenario 5: Verify System Resource Usage

Details:
  TestName: TestPrintMethodMinimalResourceUsage
  Description: Ensure that the execution of the PrintMethod does not excessively utilize system resources such as CPU or memory.
Execution:
  Arrange: Monitor resource usage before and after the method execution.
  Act: Execute Newclass.PrintMethod().
  Assert: Compare the before and after resource usage to ensure it is within acceptable limits.
Validation:
  This scenario checks for efficient use of system resources, which is essential in maintaining overall system performance and preventing issues in resource-constrained environments.
