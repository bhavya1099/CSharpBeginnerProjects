   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: Game In Initial Unstarted State

Details:
  TestName: TestGameInInitialUnstartedState
  Description: Ensure that the method DoTick correctly handles the game loop when the game has not yet started. This should initialize the game by prompting the game start screen.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of GameLoop with a list of quiz questions and a mock visualizer.
  Act: Invoke the DoTick method on the GameLoop instance.
  Assert: Verify that the DrawGameStart method of the visualizer was called.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: This ensures that the game loop correctly transitions the game from an uninitialized state to a started state by calling the DrawGameStart method on the IVisualizer instance.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: It checks if the game loop properly initiates the game, which is crucial for the correct flow and user interaction.

Scenario 2: Game With All Questions Answered

Details:
  TestName: TestGameWithAllQuestionsAnswered
  Description: Test to verify if the DoTick method correctly sets the IsFinished property when there are no unanswered questions left.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of GameLoop with an empty list of quiz questions and a mock visualizer to simulate all questions being answered.
  Act: Call the DoTick method on the GameLoop instance.
  Assert: Check that the IsFinished property of the GameLoop is true.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: This test checks whether the game correctly determines if it should finish when no more questions are unanswered.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensures that the game loop correctly handles the end of the game, allowing proper closure and transition out of game activity.

Scenario 3: Game In Progress With Unanswered Questions

Details:
  TestName: TestGameInProgressWithUnansweredQuestions
  Description: Check if the DoTick method performs the necessary methods (UpdateScreen, ProcessInput) while there are still unanswered questions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Setup a GameLoop instance with mock visualizer and a GameState containing unanswered questions.
  Act: Invoke the DoTick method.
  Assert: Ensure that UpdateScreen and ProcessInput methods are called.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test checks that the game continues to function by updating the screen and processing user input when there are questions left to answer.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Validates that the main game mechanics continue to proceed for each tick when the game shouldn't end, maintaining the interactive aspect of the game.

Scenario 4: Validate Update Screen Draw Sequence for Answered and Unanswered Questions

Details:
  TestName: TestUpdateScreenDrawSequenceForQuestionAnswers
  Description: Verify that the UpdateScreen method within DoTick handles the drawing logic appropriately based on whether the current question is answered or not.
Execution:
  Arrange: Setup a GameLoop instance with a list containing a mix of answered and unanswered quiz questions.
  Act: Call the DoTick sequentially to process multiple questions.
  Assert: Verify that DrawQuizQuestion and DrawAnswerStatus are called with correct parameters based on the question's answered status.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: Ensures that UpdateScreen correctly determines what to render (either a quiz question or answer feedback) based on the question state.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: It checks the integrity of dynamic content display during gameplay, which is critical for user understanding and game flow correctness.
