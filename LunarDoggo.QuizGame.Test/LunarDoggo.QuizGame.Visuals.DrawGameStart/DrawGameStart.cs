   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: Single Question Loaded

Details:
  TestName: DrawGameStartSingleQuestion
  Description: Tests the DrawGameStart method to ensure it properly formats the message when there is exactly one question loaded.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a variable with value 1 representing a single question.
  Act: Invoke the DrawGameStart method with the totalQuestionCount parameter as 1.
  Assert: Verify that the console output matches the string "1 question was loaded, press \"enter\" to start the game."
Validation:
  This assertion checks that the method handles singular nouns appropriately (i.e., "question" instead of "questions" and "was" instead of "were"). This test is significant as it confirms the method's ability to correctly handle grammar in single-item contexts, which is crucial for user readability and interface professionalism.

Scenario 2: Multiple Questions Loaded

Details:
  TestName: DrawGameStartMultipleQuestions
  Description: Tests whether the DrawGameStart method accurately handles output format when multiple questions are loaded.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set an integer variable with a value greater than 1 to simulate multiple questions being loaded.
  Act: Call DrawGameStart with this variable.
  Assert: Ensure that the console displays text ending with "questions were loaded, press \"enter\" to start the game."
Validation:
  Validates that the method uses plural forms ("questions" and "were") appropriately when dealing with multiple items. It's essential to test this to assure users receive clear and grammatically correct game-starting instructions for better user experience and comprehension.

Scenario 3: No Questions Loaded

Details:
  TestName: DrawGameStartZeroQuestions
  Description: Verifies the behavior of the DrawGameStart method when no questions are available (zero questions).
Execution:
  Arrange: Use a value of 0 for the totalQuestionCount parameter.
  Act: Execute DrawGameStart using this value.
  Assert: Check the console output for the text "0 questions were loaded, press \"enter\" to start the game."
Validation:
  This test confirms that the software correctly communicates the scenario of zero loaded questions to the user, maintaining proper pluralization and verb agreement. It ensures that users are informed correctly about the lack of content, which is crucial for setting proper expectations and guiding user actions under such circumstances.

Scenario 4: Negative Question Count

Details:
  TestName: DrawGameStartNegativeQuestionCount
  Description: Tests the method's robustness by passing a negative number, which typically should not occur under normal operational circumstances.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an integer with a negative value to simulate an erroneous input scenario.
  Act: Invoke DrawGameStart with this negative integer.
  Assert: Verify that the output is not erroneous or misleading, i.e., avoid breaking the format or displaying incorrect text.
Validation:
  Evaluating how the method handles unexpected or irregular input values, especially negative ones, is vital for ensuring the robustness of the application. This test helps identify potential flaws or areas for improvement in error handling and messaging, which is crucial for maintaining a reliable and user-friendly application.
