   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: Single Question Loaded

Details:
  TestName: DrawGameStartSingleQuestion
  Description: Tests the DrawGameStart method for a scenario where only one question is loaded.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an int parameter with the value 1 for totalQuestionCount.
  Act: Call the DrawGameStart method with the prepared parameter.
  Assert: Check if the output correctly states "1 question was loaded, press \"enter\" to start the game."
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the method correctly formats the output for singular quantity, which is crucial to ensure the correct language usage in user notifications. It also helps in confirming the method's ability to handle different counts correctly.

Scenario 2: Multiple Questions Loaded

Details:
  TestName: DrawGameStartMultipleQuestions
  Description: Tests the DrawGameStart method for a scenario where multiple questions are loaded.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an int parameter with a value greater than 1 (e.g., 5) for totalQuestionCount.
  Act: Call the DrawGameStart method with the prepared parameter.
  Assert: Check if the output correctly states "5 questions were loaded, press \"enter\" to start the game."
Validation:
  This test checks whether the method can handle plural forms correctly and ensures the method's capacity to adapt the output based on the question count. It also helps to maintain user clarity and correct information display when multiple questions are involved.

Scenario 3: No Questions Loaded

Details:
  TestName: DrawGameStartNoQuestions
  Description: Tests the DrawGameStart method for a scenario where no questions are loaded.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an int parameter with the value 0 for totalQuestionCount.
  Act: Call the DrawGameStart method with the prepared parameter.
  Assert: Check if the output correctly states "0 questions were loaded, press \"enter\" to start the game."
Validation:
  This test scenario ensures that the method correctly handles the case when no questions are available, avoiding misleading statements or errors. It is essential for user notifications to accurately reflect the absence of content and guide the user appropriately.

Scenario 4: Negative Questions Count

Details:
  TestName: DrawGameStartNegativeQuestionCount
  Description: Tests the DrawGameStart method for a scenario where a negative number of questions is inadvertently provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an int parameter with a negative value (e.g., -5) for totalQuestionCount.
  Act: Call the DrawGameStart method with the prepared parameter.
  Assert: Check if the output correctly handles or reports an error, perhaps by not accepting negative values.
Validation:
  This test prevents potential bugs related to incorrect data handling and ensures robustness by validating that the method does not process or misrepresent negative values inappropriately.
