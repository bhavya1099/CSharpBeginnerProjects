   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: Correct Answer Provided

Details:
  TestName: VerifyCorrectAnswerOutput
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly outputs the message indicating the user's answer is correct when the "correct" parameter is true.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of ConsoleVisualizer and a QuizQuestionAnswer object, also set up a method to capture console output.
  Act: Call DrawAnswerStatus with correct set to true.
  Assert: Check if the captured console output matches the expected success message.
Validation:
  Validation aims to verify that the output string is exactly as expected when the answer is correct. This ensures the user receives the right feedback, maintaining a consistent user experience.

Scenario 2: Incorrect Answer Provided

Details:
  TestName: VerifyIncorrectAnswerOutput
  Description: This test verifies whether the method produces the correct output when the "correct" argument is false, including displaying the correct answer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of ConsoleVisualizer and a QuizQuestionAnswer object with a specific answer, then set up a method to capture console output.
  Act: Call DrawAnswerStatus with correct set to false.
  Assert: Check if the captured console output correctly includes the pre-defined answer of the QuizQuestionAnswer object.
Validation:
  The validation checks that the feedback message includes the correct answer as specified in the QuizQuestionAnswer object. It emphasizes the importance of providing correct feedback to users to facilitate learning and correction of errors.

Scenario 3: Null QuizQuestionAnswer Provided

Details:
  TestName: VerifyBehaviorWithNullQuizQuestionAnswer
  Description: To ensure the DrawAnswerStatus method handles null QuizQuestionAnswer parameter appropriately without throwing unexpected errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of ConsoleVisualizer and pass null as the QuizQuestionAnswer object.
  Act: Call DrawAnswerStatus with a correct parameter, either true or false, while the QuizQuestionAnswer is null.
  Assert: Check for any exceptions or check the method does not crash and handles the null smoothly.
Validation:
  This test verifies the robustness of DrawAnswerStatus in handling null inputs, ensuring the application does not crash, thus maintaining reliability.

Scenario 4: Testing Method with Special Characters in Answer

Details:
  TestName: HandleSpecialCharactersInAnswerCorrectly
  Description: Validates that special characters within the answer output do not cause crashes or output errors, ensuring the application's consistency in handling diverse data.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of ConsoleVisualizer and a QuizQuestionAnswer containing special characters (e.g., quotes, newlines).
  Act: Invoke DrawAnswerStatus with correct set to false to require display of the answer.
  Assert: Verify the output correctly displays the special characters without alteration or error.
Validation:
  The test ensures that special characters are handled correctly and are presented to users as intended, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of quiz data presentation.

Scenario 5: Simulating Continuous Integration Test for Feedback Loop

Details:
  TestName: ContinuousConsoleOutputHandling
  Description: This test scenario would simulate the method being called in quick succession to check if there is any buffer overflow or performance degradation in continuous console output.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of ConsoleVisualizer, set up QuizQuestionAnswer, and prepare to capture console outputs in rapid succession.
  Act: Call DrawAnswerStatus multiple times in quick succession, alternating between correct and incorrect answers.
  Assert: Check for any performance lag or errors in console outputs.
Validation:
  By validating quick successive outputs, this scenario checks the performance of the console output handling of the application under high-load situations, ensuring it remains reliable and user-friendly.
