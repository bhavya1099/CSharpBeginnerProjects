   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: CurrentQuestionIsNull
Details:
  TestName: AnswerQuestionWhenCurrentQuestionIsNull
  Description: Verify that the method correctly handles the scenario where CurrentQuestion is null, ensuring no further changes are made to the state.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure CurrentQuestion is set to null.
  Act: Invoke AnswerQuestion method.
  Assert: Assert that givenAnswers count remains unchanged, IsCurrentQuestionAnswered remains false, and ChosenAnswer remains null.
Validation:
  Validate that the method logically prevents modifications to the game state when there is no current question defined. This reflects safe handling of instances where the game encounters an undefined state or error in question transitioning.

Scenario 2: ValidHighlightedAnswerIndex
Details:
  TestName: AnswerQuestionWithValidHighlightedAnswer
  Description: Test that AnswerQuestion correctly processes a valid highlighted answer, updating the game state accordingly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize CurrentQuestion with multiple answers, set a valid highlightedAnswerIndex.
  Act: Invoke AnswerQuestion method.
  Assert: Validate that the CurrentQuestion is removed from unansweredQuestions and added to givenAnswers with the correct IsCorrect value, and IsCurrentQuestionAnswered is set to true.
Validation:
  This verifies the method's ability to handle normal game flow, ensuring that given answers are tracked correctly, and the game state moves forward as expected.

Scenario 3: OutOfRangeHighlightedAnswerIndex
Details:
  TestName: AnswerQuestionWithOutOfRangeHighlightedAnswer
  Description: Check method behavior when highlightedAnswerIndex is larger than the answer list size.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize CurrentQuestion with a smaller number of answers than the index set for highlightedAnswerIndex.
  Act: Invoke AnswerQuestion.
  Assert: Assert an exception is thrown due to array out-of-range access or utilize a safeguard if implemented.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method can gracefully manage or report incorrect index values, which could stem from faulty game logic or unexpected user manipulation, thus maintaining application robustness.

Scenario 4: HighlightedAnswerIsCorrect
Details:
  TestName: AnswerQuestionWithCorrectHighlightedAnswer
  Description: Confirm that the game state correctly reflects a correct answer being chosen via highlightedAnswerIndex.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set highlightedAnswerIndex to point to a correct answer within CurrentQuestion's answers.
  Act: Invoke AnswerQuestion method.
  Assert: Check that givenAnswers correctly stores the 'true' value associated with the correct answer, and the ChosenAnswer reflects this choice.
Validation:
  This scenario confirms that the game correctly identifies and logs correct answers, a key component in score calculation and game progression.

Scenario 5: NoAnswersAvailableInCurrentQuestion
Details:
  TestName: AnswerQuestionWithNoAnswersAvailable
  Description: Assess handling by AnswerQuestion when there are no answers provided in CurrentQuestion.
Execution:
  Arrange: Give CurrentQuestion an empty answer array and an appropriate highlightedAnswerIndex.
  Act: Invoke AnswerQuestion method.
  Assert: Ensure that no changes occur in game state due to lack of available answers to process.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the methodâ€™s resilience against data anomalies or unexpected empty states, helping to maintain stability and predictability in gameplay.
