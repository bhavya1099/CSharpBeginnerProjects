   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: CurrentQuestionIsNull
Details:
  TestName: AnswerQuestionWhenCurrentQuestionIsNull
  Description: Verify that the method correctly handles the scenario where CurrentQuestion is null, ensuring no further changes are made to the state.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure CurrentQuestion is set to null.
  Act: Invoke the AnswerQuestion method.
  Assert: Confirm that the collections 'unansweredQuestions' and 'givenAnswers' remain unchanged.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that nothing happens when there is no current question to answer. It ensures program stability and data integrity in cases where there might not be a current question set.

Scenario 2: ValidHighlightAnswerIndex
Details:
  TestName: AnswerQuestionWithValidHighlightedAnswerIndex
  Description: Validate that the AnswerQuestion method works as intended when a valid highlightedAnswerIndex is used with an existing CurrentQuestion.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize CurrentQuestion with multiple answers and a valid 'highlightedAnswerIndex'.
  Act: Invoke the AnswerQuestion method.
  Assert: Confirm that the given answer is recorded in 'givenAnswers', the question is removed from 'unansweredQuestions', and 'IsCurrentQuestionAnswered' is set to true.
Validation:
  To verify that the method accurately processes the answers based on a valid highlighted index, updating the game state appropriately. It ensures the functionality supports normal quiz answering behavior.

Scenario 3: IndexOutOfBoundsHandling
Details:
  TestName: AnswerQuestionWithInvalidHighlightedAnswerIndex
  Description: Check how the AnswerQuestion method behaves if the 'highlightedAnswerIndex' is out of bounds (negative or exceeds number of answers).
Execution:
  Arrange: Set 'highlightedAnswerIndex' beyond the array bounds of the CurrentQuestion's answers.
  Act: Call the AnswerQuestion method, possibly wrapping the method call in a try-catch to observe exception throwing.
  Assert: Use assertions to check appropriate exception handling or error logging.
Validation:
  Checks whether the application gracefully handles a common error case, avoiding potential crashes and ensuring robustness.

Scenario 4: VerifyChangesInGameState
Details:
  TestName: AnswerQuestionUpdatesGameStateProperly
  Description: Confirm that all GameState properties are appropriately updated after answering a question, which includes checking correct count adjustments and state changes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a GameState with a current question and a valid 'highlightedAnswerIndex'.
  Act: Run the AnswerQuestion method.
  Assert: Validate that 'TotalQuestionCount', 'AnsweredQuestionCount', and other properties reflect the new state correctly.
Validation:
  This enforces the overall integrity and consistency of the game logic by ensuring that each answered question brings accurate state transition and tracking. This is crucial for maintaining correct gameplay statistics and user feedback.

Scenario 5: IsCorrectFlagUsage
Details:
  TestName: AnswerQuestionCorrectlyReflectsIsCorrect
  Description: Evaluate whether the correctness of an answer reflected by 'IsCorrect' flag in 'QuizQuestionAnswer' is accurately captured in 'givenAnswers' dictionary.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set an arbitrary answer as highlighted, marking it as either true or false using the 'IsCorrect' property.
  Act: Invoke the AnswerQuestion method.
  Assert: Confirm that the corresponding correctness value is accurately stored in 'givenAnswers' for the answered question.
Validation:
  This assures that the quiz correctly records whether an answered question was answered correctly or not, which is fundamental for scoring and feedback mechanisms within the game.

These scenarios collectively ensure comprehensive testing of method functionality across typical and edge cases, highlighting the method's robustness and correctness under varied conditions.
