   ########## Test - Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: Reset When All Tiles Are Initially Empty

Details:
  TestName: ResetWithEmptyBoard
  Description: Verifies that the Reset method correctly handles a board where all tiles are initially set to zero, ensuring that the method does not alter the state incorrectly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a TicTacToe board instance where all tiles are set to zero.
  Act: Call the Reset method on this TicTacToe instance.
  Assert: Check that all tiles remain at zero after the method execution.
Validation:
  This assertion confirms that the Reset method does not mistakenly modify tiles that are already in the desired reset state (zero). It's significant because it ensures the method's safety in scenarios where the board is already reset.

Scenario 2: Reset When All Tiles Are Occupied

Details:
  TestName: ResetWithFullyOccupiedBoard
  Description: Ensures that the Reset method successfully resets a fully occupied board (all tiles non-zero) to a state where all tiles are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a TicTacToe board instance and set all tiles to a non-zero value.
  Act: Call the Reset method on this TicTacToe instance.
  Assert: Verify that all tiles are set back to zero.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the Reset method correctly sets all tile values to zero, effectively clearing the board. This test is crucial as it simulates the typical use case where the game needs to be reset after completion or before a new game.

Scenario 3: Reset On A Partially Filled Board

Details:
  TestName: ResetWithPartiallyFilledBoard
  Description: Tests whether the Reset method can handle a board with a mix of zero and non-zero values, ensuring all values are reset to zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a TicTacToe board with some tiles set to zero and others set to non-zero values.
  Act: Invoke the Reset method on this board.
  Assert: Ensure all tiles are reset to zero.
Validation:
  This test checks the ability of the Reset method to fully clear the board irrespective of its initial state. Itâ€™s vital for ensuring game integrity between sessions.

Scenario 4: Concurrent Reset Invocation

Details:
  TestName: ResetConcurrently
  Description: Checks if calling Reset concurrently from multiple threads results in the correct final state of all zeros for all tiles, without any race conditions or data corruption.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a fully occupied board, then call Reset from multiple threads simultaneously.
  Act: Execute the concurrent Reset invocations.
  Assert: Confirm that all tiles are set to zero.
Validation:
  This test ensures thread-safety and reliability of the Reset method under concurrent usage scenarios, which might occur in a multi-player networked game environment.

Scenario 5: Reset Method Completeness

Details:
  TestName: ResetCompletenessTest
  Description: Validates that the Reset method covers all elements of the board by ensuring no tile is left untouched.
Execution:
  Arrange: Access the TicTacToe board directly to track resets on each tile using a mock or intercept approach.
  Act: Call the Reset function.
  Assert: Check if every tile in the 3x3 board was set to zero.
Validation:
  This confirms that the Reset method interacts with every single tile, crucial for confirming the comprehensive application of intended logic, avoiding any oversight in array handling.
