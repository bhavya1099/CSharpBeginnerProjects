   ########## Test - Scenarios ##########  

### Test Scenario Generation for the `StartGame` Method in TicTacToe Namespace

---

**Scenario 1: VerifyTilesResetEventTriggered**

Details:
  TestName: VerifyTilesResetEventTriggered
  Description: Ensures that when StartGame is called, the TilesReset event is triggered correctly.

Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the game and subscribe to the TilesReset event with a listener that sets a flag or counts the triggers.
  Act: Call the StartGame method.
  Assert: Check that the TilesReset event was triggered exactly once.

Validation:
  Clarify that the TilesReset event invocation is expected because StartGame resets the game board, which accordingly should notify subscribers of this reset. This is important to ensure that all external components relying on the game state are informed about the reset, maintaining the consistency of the game's state across all components.

---

**Scenario 2: VerifyCurrentPlayerSetToFirstPlayer**

Details:
  TestName: VerifyCurrentPlayerSetToFirstPlayer
  Description: Verifies that the currentPlayer is set to firstPlayer when the StartGame is invoked.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the game ensuring firstPlayer and currentPlayer are set correctly initially.
  Act: Invoke the StartGame method.
  Assert: Assert that currentPlayer is equal to firstPlayer after method execution.

Validation:
  Clarify that setting the currentPlayer to firstPlayer is crucial as StartGame should symbolize the start of a new game where the firstPlayer is given the privilege to play first. This test confirms that game logic regarding player turns initializes correctly.

---

**Scenario 3: VerifyGameBoardResetCalled**

Details:
  TestName: VerifyGameBoardResetCalled
  Description: Checks if the gameBoard's Reset method is called when StartGame is executed.

Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the gameBoard to track method calls, particularly the Reset method.
  Act: Execute the StartGame method.
  Assert: Verify that the Reset method on the gameBoard mock was called exactly once.

Validation:
  Clarify that the game board needs to be cleared when starting a new game to ensure that the game starts fresh with no residual data. This test is significant to confirm that the game state is correctly initialized, preventing any gameplay issues related to stale or unintended game states.

---

These scenarios thoroughly test the StartGame functionality, checking the correct behavior of the game in response to a new start, both in terms of internal state and external event notifications. Each scenario focuses on a key aspect of the StartGame methodâ€™s responsibilities, ensuring comprehensive coverage of its behavior.
