   ########## Test - Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: Player Has Won by Completing a Row

Details:
  TestName: TestPlayerHasWonByRow
  Description: This test checks if the HasWon method correctly identifies a win condition when a player has all tiles in any single row.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a TicTacToe game where a player has all tiles marked in one row.
  Act: Call the HasWon method with the player's identifier.
  Assert: Check if the method returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the HasWon method accurately detects a winning row configuration, which is critical for correctly determining the end of the game and the winner. This test ensures the game logic correctly implements row-wise win conditions as per game rules.

Scenario 2: Player Has Won by Completing a Column

Details:
  TestName: TestPlayerHasWonByColumn
  Description: This test verifies if the HasWon method can identify a win scenario where a player has all tiles in any single column.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the game state where a player controls all tiles in a specific column.
  Act: Invoke the HasWon method with this player's byte identifier.
  Assert: The result should be true.
Validation:
  This test ensures that column-wise win conditions are correctly implemented. The assertion checks for the correct recognition of winning patterns, which is essential for accurate game state assessments and determining the correct outcome of matches.

Scenario 3: Player Has Won by Completing Diagonal

Details:
  TestName: TestPlayerHasWonByDiagonal
  Description: This test evaluates whether the HasWon method successfully recognizes a diagonal win from top-left to bottom-right or vice versa.
Execution:
  Arrange: Configure the tiles array such that a player has all diagonal tiles marked from one corner to the opposite.
  Act: Execute the HasWon method for this player.
  Assert: Expect true to be returned from the method.
Validation:
  The correctness of this test is vital for enforcing the game rules that consider diagonal wins as a valid victory condition. The assertion proves that the logic to check diagonal winning conditions works correctly, maintaining the game's integrity and fairness.

Scenario 4: No Winning Condition Met

Details:
  TestName: TestNoWinningConditionMet
  Description: This test checks that the HasWon method returns false when there is no win condition present on the board.
Execution:
  Arrange: Setup a game scenario where no rows, columns, or diagonals have all tiles marked by the same player.
  Act: Invoke the HasWon method for a player likely not to have won.
  Assert: Determine that false is returned.
Validation:
  This scenario is critical for ensuring the game does not falsely declare a winner when no win conditions have been met. The test validates that the game accurately reflects ongoing play or a draw scenario, preventing premature game termination.

Scenario 5: Player Has Won on Edge Case Near Full Board

Details:
  TestName: TestPlayerWinsOnEdgeCaseFullBoard
  Description: Tests whether the HasWon method can still accurately detect a win in scenarios where almost all tiles are filled, focusing on boundary conditions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a nearly complete game where only one move leads to a win condition on the last available tile.
  Act: Perform this winning move and then call the HasWon method.
  Assert: Expect a return of true from HasWon.
Validation:
  This test checks if the method can handle complete or near-complete board states without failing or providing incorrect results. It ensures the robustness and reliability of the game logic even in complex scenarios, upholding the game's functionality and user experience.
