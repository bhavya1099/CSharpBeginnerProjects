   ########## Test - Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: Successful Tile Occupation By Player

Details:
  TestName: TestSuccessfulTileOccupation
  Description: Tests that the method correctly handles a scenario where a tile can be successfully occupied by the current player.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a ButtonTileMapping object with valid coordinates. Ensure gameBoard.OccupyTile returns true for these coordinates.
  Act: Call OccupiedTile with the setup mapping object.
  Assert: Verify that SwitchPlayer() is invoked.
Validation:
  Clarify that the currentPlayer is changed affirming proper turn rotation. Validates the application's ability to handle turn-based changes effectively under normal game conditions.

Scenario 2: Tile Already Occupied

Details:
  TestName: TestTileAlreadyOccupied
  Description: Verifies the method handles scenarios where the specified tile is already occupied.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a ButtonTileMapping object with coordinates of an already occupied tile. Ensure gameBoard.OccupyTile returns false.
  Act: Call OccupiedTile with this mapping object.
  Assert: Check that TileAlreadyOccupied event is triggered.
Validation:
  Validate that the event handler is activated on failed tile occupation due to preoccupation, ensuring the game alerts properly under such conditions.

Scenario 3: Game Won By Current Player

Details:
  TestName: TestGameWonByCurrentPlayer
  Description: Checks if the method properly detects a win situation after a tile is occupied.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a ButtonTileMapping object and let gameBoard.OccupyTile return true. Configure gameBoard.HasWon to return true for the currentPlayer.
  Act: Invoke OccupyTile method with the mapping.
  Assert: Assert that GameOverPlayerWon event is invoked.
Validation:
  This test ensures that winning the game triggers the correct event, critical for ending the game and notifying participants of the outcome.

Scenario 4: Game Draw

Details:
  TestName: TestGameEndsInDraw
  Description: Assesses the methodâ€™s response when the game ends in a draw after the last tile is occupied without a winner.
Execution:
  Arrange: Arrange a scenario where all fields are occupied and no player has won. Ensure gameBoard.OccupyTile and gameBoard.AreAllFieldsOccupied both return true, while gameBoard.HasWon returns false.
  Act: Call the OccupyTile method.
  Assert: Assert GameOverDraw event is invoked.
Validation:
  Validates that the game correctly identifies and handles a draw scenario, essential for fairness and accurate game termination.

Scenario 5: Game Continues After Valid Move

Details:
  TestName: TestGameContinuesAfterValidMove
  Description: Ensures the game continues correctly if a valid move does not result in a win or draw.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the gameBoard to return true for OccupyTile and false for both HasWon and AreAllFieldsOccupied.
  Act: Execute the OccupyTile with appropriate parameters.
  Assert: Verify that SwitchPlayer is called and no game-ending events are triggered.
Validation:
  Confirms the game logic persists players' turns under typical gameplay circumstances, essential for uninterrupted game play.
