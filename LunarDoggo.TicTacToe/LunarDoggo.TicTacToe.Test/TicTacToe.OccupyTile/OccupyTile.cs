   ########## Test - Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: Successful Tile Occupation

Details:
  TestName: TestSuccessfulTileOccupation
  Description: Checks if a tile is successfully occupied by a player when it is unoccupied prior to the request.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a player instance and set tile coordinates that are unoccupied.
  Act: Call the OccupyTile method with the created player instance and specified coordinates.
  Assert: Assert that the method returns true.
Validation:
  This test validates that the OccupyTile method properly allows a player to occupy an unoccupied tile. It confirms the method's core functionality of changing tile states accurately according to game rules. The significance is to ensure the game board updates correctly according to player actions.

Scenario 2: Attempt to Occupy Already Occupied Tile

Details:
  TestName: TestOccupationOfOccupiedTile
  Description: Ensures that the OccupyTile method returns false when a player attempts to occupy a tile that is already occupied.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a player instance and set coordinates for a tile that is pre-occupied.
  Act: Invoke the OccupyTile method with the designated player and tile coordinates.
  Assert: Assert that the method returns false.
Validation:
  The test checks the method's error handling capabilities when facing an invalid action. Verifying that the action is denied emphasizes the game’s rule enforcement, ensuring players cannot override already occupied tiles, thus maintaining game integrity.

Scenario 3: PlayerOccupiedTile Event Trigger on Successful Occupation

Details:
  TestName: TestEventTriggerOnSuccessfulOccupation
  Description: Test whether the PlayerOccupiedTile event is triggered upon successful tile occupation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a player, subscribe to the PlayerOccupiedTile event, set up an event handler to capture the event, and define an unoccupied tile’s coordinates.
  Act: Call OccupyTile with the defined parameters.
  Assert: Check that the event handler captured the event.
Validation:
  Validates that the PlayerOccupiedTile event is correctly triggered, linking game logic with event-based notifications. This is crucial for aspects like UI updates or further game logic that rely on such events.

Scenario 4: Boundary Coordinates Test

Details:
  TestName: TestBoundaryCoordinatesOccupation
  Description: Ensures that the OccupyTile method correctly handles edge boundary coordinates of the game board.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a player instance and set coordinates on the boundaries such as (0,0) or (2,2).
  Act: Call the OccupyTile method with these boundary coordinates.
  Assert: Assert that the response is true for unoccupied boundaries or false for occupied ones.
Validation:
  Ensures robustness in the method's handling of all valid coordinate inputs. Critical for avoiding out-of-bound errors or incorrect gameplay on boundary scenarios.

Scenario 5: Invalid Coordinates Test

Details:
  TestName: TestInvalidCoordinates
  Description: Attempts to occupy a tile using coordinates that are out of the allowed range.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a player instance and set up coordinates outside the game board dimensions like (-1,-1) or (3,3).
  Act: Invoke the OccupyTile method with these parameters.
  Assert: Catch any thrown exceptions or check for false return value depending on implementation.
Validation:
  Validates method's robustness in handling incorrect input. Ensuring that the method does not fail silently or corrupt game state when faced with invalid coordinates supports the overall stability and reliability of the game logic.
