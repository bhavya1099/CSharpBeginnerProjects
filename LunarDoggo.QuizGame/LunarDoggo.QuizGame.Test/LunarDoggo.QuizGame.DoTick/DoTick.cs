   ########## Test - Scenarios ##########  

### Scenario 1: Normal Game Tick with Unanswered Questions

Details:
  TestName: NormalGameTickWithUnansweredQuestions
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the DoTick method during a normal game cycle where there are still unanswered questions.

Execution:
  Arrange: 
    - Create a GameState instance with unanswered questions.
    - Mock the UpdateScreen and ProcessInput methods to simulate their behavior.
  Act: 
    - Call the DoTick method on the game instance.
  Assert: 
    - Verify that IsFinished remains false.
    - Ensure UpdateScreen and ProcessInput methods are called once.

Validation:
  - The assertion verifies that the game does not prematurely conclude if there are unanswered questions left. This is significant to ensure the game continues until all questions are answered, adhering to the core gameplay mechanics.

### Scenario 2: Final Game Tick with All Questions Answered

Details:
  TestName: FinalGameTickWithAllQuestionsAnswered
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the DoTick method when it is the last tick of the game, meaning all questions have been answered.

Execution:
  Arrange: 
    - Create a GameState instance indicating all questions are answered.
    - Mock the UpdateScreen and ProcessInput methods.
  Act: 
    - Invoke the DoTick method.
  Assert: 
    - Verify that IsFinished is set to true.
    - Confirm that both UpdateScreen and ProcessInput are called once.

Validation:
  - This test is crucial to confirm that the game correctly concludes when there are no remaining questions. It checks the proper setting of the IsFinished flag, which controls game progression and termination.

### Scenario 3: DoTick Invocation Before Game Start

Details:
  TestName: DoTickInvocationBeforeGameStart
  Description: This test ensures that the DoTick method behaves correctly if invoked before the game has officially started.

Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create a game instance where isStarted is set to false.
    - Mock the UpdateScreen and ProcessInput methods without any specific behavior.
  Act:
    - Call the DoTick method.
  Assert:
    - Check that UpdateScreen and ProcessInput are not called.

Validation:
  - The assertion that UpdateScreen and ProcessInput are not called when the game hasn't started ensures that no game actions are processed prematurely. This maintains the integrity of game flow and state management.

### Scenario 4: Error Handling for Null State in DoTick

Details:
  TestName: ErrorHandlingForNullStateInDoTick
  Description: This test checks how the DoTick method handles a situation where the GameState instance is null.

Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set the GameState instance of the game to null.
  Act:
    - Attempt to invoke the DoTick method.
  Assert:
    - Expect an appropriate exception to be thrown due to the null state.

Validation:
  - Testing for null state handling is pivotal for robustness, ensuring that the method does not fail silently or cause unexpected behavior. It verifies proper error management within the game loop, crucial for maintaining a stable application.
