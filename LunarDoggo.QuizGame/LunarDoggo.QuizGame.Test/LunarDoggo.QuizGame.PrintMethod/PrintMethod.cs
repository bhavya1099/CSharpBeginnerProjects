   ########## Test - Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: Verify Console Output

Details:
  TestName: VerifyConsoleOutputIsCorrect
  Description: This test verifies that the static method PrintMethod correctly outputs the expected string to the console.
Execution:
  Arrange: Redirect the console output to a StringWriter for capturing the output.
  Act: Call the PrintMethod.
  Assert: Check that the output captured in the StringWriter matches the expected string "jst in case".
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: The test validates that the method outputs the exact string to the console, ensuring the method's reliability in displaying correct information.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business rules: Ensuring the correct console output is crucial for the accuracy of logs or user-directed messages, which may be critical in a production environment or debugging scenarios.

Scenario 2: Console Output Encoding Integrity

Details:
  TestName: ValidateConsoleOutputEncoding
  Description: This test ensures that the encoding of the console output remains unchanged after the method execution.
Execution:
  Arrange: Store the current Console.OutputEncoding setting.
  Act: Call the PrintMethod.
  Assert: Compare the pre-stored Console.OutputEncoding with the encoding after the method execution to ensure they are the same.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: The test checks that the PrintMethod does not alter the console's output encoding, which could affect other parts of the application where specific encoding is required.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business rules: Maintaining consistent encoding is essential for applications that rely on specific character sets for proper display and processing of information.

Scenario 3: Multiple Sequential Invocations

Details:
  TestName: CheckOutputConsistencyAcrossMultipleCalls
  Description: This test checks if calling PrintMethod multiple times in succession results in the correct repeated output without any errors or changes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Redirect console output and prepare to call the method multiple times.
  Act: Call PrintMethod multiple times in a loop.
  Assert: Verify that the output is the expected string repeated for each call without alteration.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: Ensures that the method consistently outputs the correct string on each call and can handle repeated invocations without failure.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business rules: Reliable and consistent output in repeated method invocations is crucial for tasks that require frequent updates to user interfaces or logs.

These scenarios ensure thorough testing of the PrintMethod under various conditions, verifying its reliability and stability in different operational contexts.
