   ########## Test - Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: Validate Console Output For No Questions Loaded

Details:
  TestName: VerifyConsoleOutputWhenNoQuestions
  Description: This test checks whether the correct message is displayed to the console when no questions are loaded.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare to capture the console output.
  Act: Call the `DrawNoQuestions` method.
  Assert: Verify that the console output matches the expected message.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: The assertion checks that the exact message "No questions were loaded, please enter some questions into the json file in the applications folder.\n\nReload game? (Y/N)" is printed to the console. This is crucial as it informs the user about the absence of questions and provides a directive to reload the game.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business rules: Ensuring that the correct message is displayed helps in user interaction and guides them on how to proceed when no questions are found, which is a fundamental part of user experience in the context of the application.

Scenario 2: Check Console Response Handling

Details:
  TestName: VerifyConsoleResponseToReloadOption
  Description: This test verifies if the application is waiting for user input after prompting to reload the game.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the console input to simulate user response.
  Act: Call the `DrawNoQuestions` method and simulate inputting 'Y' or 'N'.
  Assert: Check if the application correctly reads and potentially acts on the input.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: The assertion checks that user input is correctly captured after the message is displayed. This verifies that the application is interactive and responsive to user commands.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business rules: Testing how the application handles user input is essential for ensuring that the game can be appropriately reloaded or exited based on user preference, which is critical for usability and user control over application flow.

Scenario 3: Error Handling When Console Input Is Invalid

Details:
  TestName: VerifyHandlingOfInvalidConsoleInput
  Description: This test checks the application's resilience and error handling when an unexpected character or string is entered in response to the reload prompt.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the console input to provide an invalid response like "ABC".
  Act: Call the `DrawNoQuestions` method and provide the mocked input.
  Assert: Ensure that the application does not crash and handles the input gracefully, possibly prompting the user again.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: The assertion checks for application stability and error handling capabilities when faced with invalid input. This ensures that the application is robust and error-tolerant.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business rules: Robust handling of invalid inputs is critical to maintaining a smooth user experience and preventing crashes, which enhances the overall reliability of the application.
