   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: Test for successful tile occupation
Details:
  TestName: TestSuccessfulTileOccupation
  Description: This test is meant to check if a tile can be successfully occupied by a player. It is a basic functionality of the game and is a normal scenario.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a new GameState with mappings and a new GameBoard. Set the currentPlayer to firstPlayer.
  Act: Call the OccupyTile method with a mapping for an unoccupied tile.
  Assert: Check the state of the tile in gameBoard to see if it has been occupied by the currentPlayer.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that a tile can be successfully occupied by a player. This is expected as it is a basic game functionality and the tile was initially unoccupied. This test is important to ensure that the basic game mechanics are working as expected.

Scenario 2: Test for unsuccessful tile occupation due to tile already being occupied
Details:
  TestName: TestUnsuccessfulTileOccupationDueToOccupiedTile
  Description: This test is meant to check if a player can occupy a tile that has already been occupied by another player. This should not be possible as per the game rules.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a new GameState with mappings and a new GameBoard. Set the currentPlayer to firstPlayer and occupy a tile.
  Act: Call the OccupyTile method with the same mapping as used earlier.
  Assert: Check that the TileAlreadyOccupied event is triggered.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that a tile already occupied by a player cannot be occupied by another player. This is expected as per the game rules. This test is important to ensure that the game rules are being enforced correctly.

Scenario 3: Test for game over due to a player winning
Details:
  TestName: TestGameOverDueToPlayerWin
  Description: This test is meant to check if the game ends when a player has won. A player wins when they have occupied a row, column or diagonal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a new GameState with mappings and a new GameBoard. Set the currentPlayer to firstPlayer and occupy a row, column or diagonal.
  Act: Call the OccupyTile method with a mapping for the last tile in the row, column or diagonal.
  Assert: Check that the GameOverPlayerWon event is triggered.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the game ends when a player has won. This is expected as per the game rules. This test is important to ensure that the game ends appropriately when a player has won.

Scenario 4: Test for game over due to a draw
Details:
  TestName: TestGameOverDueToDraw
  Description: This test is meant to check if the game ends when all tiles have been occupied and no player has won. This situation is a draw.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a new GameState with mappings and a new GameBoard. Set the currentPlayer to firstPlayer and secondPlayer alternately and occupy all tiles without any player winning.
  Act: Call the OccupyTile method with a mapping for the last unoccupied tile.
  Assert: Check that the GameOverDraw event is triggered.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the game ends in a draw when all tiles have been occupied and no player has won. This is expected as per the game rules. This test is important to ensure that the game ends appropriately in case of a draw.
