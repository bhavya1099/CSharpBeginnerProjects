   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: Test for successful tile occupation
Details:
  TestName: TestOccupationOfValidTile
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method OccupyTile allows a player to successfully occupy a tile that has not been previously occupied.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create the required GameState instance and ButtonTileMapping instance with coordinates of an unoccupied tile.
  Act: Invoke the OccupyTile method with the created ButtonTileMapping instance.
  Assert: Use NUnit assertions to check if the tile occupation was successful.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the tile has been successfully occupied by the current player. This is crucial for ensuring the proper functioning of the game as players should be able to occupy unoccupied tiles.

Scenario 2: Test for unsuccessful tile occupation
Details:
  TestName: TestOccupationOfAlreadyOccupiedTile
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method OccupyTile prevents a player from occupying a tile that has already been occupied.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create the required GameState instance and ButtonTileMapping instance with coordinates of an already occupied tile.
  Act: Invoke the OccupyTile method with the created ButtonTileMapping instance.
  Assert: Use NUnit assertions to check if the tile occupation was unsuccessful.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the tile occupation was unsuccessful because the tile was already occupied. This is crucial for maintaining the rules of the game as a player should not be able to occupy a tile that has already been occupied.

Scenario 3: Test for switching player after successful tile occupation
Details:
  TestName: TestPlayerSwitchAfterSuccessfulTileOccupation
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method OccupyTile switches the current player after a successful tile occupation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create the required GameState instance and ButtonTileMapping instance with coordinates of an unoccupied tile.
  Act: Invoke the OccupyTile method with the created ButtonTileMapping instance.
  Assert: Use NUnit assertions to check if the current player has been switched.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the current player has been switched after a successful tile occupation. This is important for ensuring the turn-based nature of the game.

Scenario 4: Test for game over when a player has won
Details:
  TestName: TestGameOverWhenPlayerHasWon
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method OccupyTile triggers the GameOverPlayerWon event when a player has won the game.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create the required GameState instance and ButtonTileMapping instance such that the occupation of the tile will lead to a win for the current player.
  Act: Invoke the OccupyTile method with the created ButtonTileMapping instance.
  Assert: Use NUnit assertions to check if the GameOverPlayerWon event has been triggered.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the GameOverPlayerWon event is triggered when a player wins the game. This is crucial for ending the game and declaring the winner.

Scenario 5: Test for game over when all fields have been occupied without a win
Details:
  TestName: TestGameOverWhenAllFieldsOccupiedWithoutWin
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method OccupyTile triggers the GameOverDraw event when all fields have been occupied without a win.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create the required GameState instance and ButtonTileMapping instance such that the occupation of the tile will lead to all fields being occupied without a win.
  Act: Invoke the OccupyTile method with the created ButtonTileMapping instance.
  Assert: Use NUnit assertions to check if the GameOverDraw event has been triggered.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the GameOverDraw event is triggered when all fields have been occupied without a win. This is crucial for ending the game and declaring a draw.
