   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  


Scenario 1: Occupying an Empty Tile and Winning the Game

Details:
  TestName: TestOccupyTileAndWinGame
  Description: Verify that when a player occupies an empty tile that leads to a win, the game ends with the player winning.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a game state with specific mappings and positions.
  Act: Occupy a tile that results in the player winning.
  Assert: Check if the GameOverPlayerWon event is triggered.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the game correctly identifies a winning move and ends the game with the winning player. This test ensures the win condition is correctly implemented.

Scenario 2: Occupying a Tile Already Occupied

Details:
  TestName: TestOccupyAlreadyOccupiedTile
  Description: Ensure that attempting to occupy a tile that is already occupied triggers the TileAlreadyOccupied event.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a game state with a pre-occupied tile.
  Act: Try to occupy the same tile again.
  Assert: Verify that the TileAlreadyOccupied event is raised.
Validation:
  This test checks the behavior when a player tries to occupy a tile that is already taken. It ensures that the game handles this scenario appropriately.

Scenario 3: Occupying the Last Empty Tile Resulting in a Draw

Details:
  TestName: TestOccupyLastEmptyTileDraw
  Description: Validate that occupying the last empty tile without any player winning results in a draw.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a game state where only one empty tile is left.
  Act: Occupy the remaining empty tile.
  Assert: Check if the GameOverDraw event is fired.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the game correctly detects a draw when all tiles are occupied without a win condition being met.

Scenario 4: Switching Players After Occupying a Tile

Details:
  TestName: TestSwitchPlayerAfterOccupyingTile
  Description: Confirm that after successfully occupying a tile, the player turn switches to the next player.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a game state with a player occupying a tile.
  Act: Occupy a tile and trigger the switch player logic.
  Assert: Verify that the player turn changes to the next player.
Validation:
  This test validates that the game correctly alternates between players after each successful tile occupation.

Scenario 5: Failing to Occupy a Tile Due to Tile Already Occupied

Details:
  TestName: TestFailToOccupyTileAlreadyOccupied
  Description: Check that when trying to occupy an already occupied tile, the game does not progress and the TileAlreadyOccupied event is raised.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a game state with a pre-occupied tile.
  Act: Attempt to occupy the same tile.
  Assert: Ensure that the game state remains unchanged and the TileAlreadyOccupied event is triggered.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the game handles the scenario of trying to occupy an already occupied tile correctly by not allowing the player to make an invalid move.
