   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: Successfully occupy an unoccupied tile

Details:
  TestName: OccupyUnoccupiedTileSuccessfully
  Description: This test verifies that the method correctly occupies an unoccupied tile and switches players if no win or draw condition is met.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the gameState with mock data where no tiles are occupied and set the currentPlayer.
  Act: Call the OccupyTile method with a mapping that corresponds to an unoccupied tile.
  Assert: Verify that the TileAlreadyOccupied event is not triggered.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the tile becomes occupied and the OccupiedTile event is triggered. This is important to ensure that the game progresses correctly when a tile is occupied normally.

Scenario 2: Attempt to occupy an already occupied tile

Details:
  TestName: TryToOccupyAlreadyOccupiedTile
  Description: This test ensures that the method correctly identifies when a tile is already occupied and triggers the appropriate event.
Execution:
  Arrange: Setup the gameState with mock data indicating a tile is already occupied.
  Act: Call the OccupyTile method with a mapping for the already occupied tile.
  Assert: Expect the TileAlreadyOccupied event to be triggered.
Validation:
  The test checks that the TileAlreadyOccupied event is fired, which is key for alerting players that the chosen tile cannot be selected.

Scenario 3: Player wins the game by occupying the last required tile for a win condition

Details:
  TestName: OccupyTileAndWinTheGame
  Description: Verify that occupying a specific tile that results in a winning condition correctly ends the game with a win notification.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the gameState where the currentPlayer is one move away from winning the game.
  Act: Occupy the winning tile using the OccupyTile method.
  Assert: Check that the GameOverPlayerWon event is triggered with the correct player data.
Validation:
  Validate that the GameOverPlayerWon event correctly identifies the winning player. This confirms that the win detection logic in the game works properly.

Scenario 4: Game ends in a draw after the last tile is occupied

Details:
  TestName: OccupyLastTileEndingInDraw
  Description: This test ensures the game correctly identifies a draw when the last unoccupied tile is occupied without meeting any player's win condition.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up gameState where only one tile is unoccupied and occupying it does not result in a win.
  Act: Occupy the final tile.
  Assert: Expect the GameOverDraw event to be triggered.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies the GameOverDraw event's trigger, confirming the game accurately identifies draw conditions when no tiles remain.

Scenario 5: Switch Player on successful tile occupation

Details:
  TestName: SwitchPlayerOnSuccessfulTileOccupation
  Description: Check that the method switches the current player when a tile is successfully occupied without ending the game.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare gameState with multiple unoccupied tiles and ensure current player is set.
  Act: Occupy a tile successfully where no win or draw is achieved.
  Assert: Verify that the currentPlayer has been switched.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that currentPlayer changes, which is crucial for the correct turn-based mechanics of the game.
