   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

**Scenario 1: Successful Tile Occupancy When Tile Is Free**

Details:
  TestName: TestSuccessfulOccupancyOnFreeTile
  Description: This test checks if the method correctly occupies a tile that is not already occupied and subsequently fires either a player switch, a win condition, or a draw condition depending on the state of the board.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a GameBoard and a ButtonTileMapping object where the specified tile (TileX, TileY) is not occupied.
  Act: Invoke the OccupyTile method with the free tile mapping.
  Assert: Assert OccupiedTile event is triggered, check if the corresponding player move updates, and also verify if the SwitchPlayer method is invoked depending on the game state.

Validation:
  Ensure that the tile is occupied by the current player and the board reflects this change. This test validates that the basic game logic for occupying a tile is functioning as expected.

**Scenario 2: Attempt to Occupy an Already Occupied Tile**

Details:
  TestName: TestOccupancyOnAlreadyOccupiedTile
  Description: Tests the method's response when trying to occupy a tile that is already taken. The TileAlreadyOccupied event should be fired.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a GameBoard with a predetermined occupied tile. Set up the ButtonTileMapping for the same tile.
  Act: Call the OccupyTile method with the already occupied tile mapping.
  Assert: Assert that the TileAlreadyOccupied event is correctly triggered.

Validation:
  Confirm that no changes to the board state occur and the TileAlreadyOccupied event fires, ensuring that the game rules are enforced correctly about tile occupation.

**Scenario 3: Winning Move Occupancy**

Details:
  TestName: TestWinningMoveOccupancy
  Description: Ensure that a player's move that results in a win correctly fires the GameOverPlayerWon event with the winning player's information.

Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the GameState and GameBoard so that the current player's next move will be a winning move.
  Act: Execute the OccupyTile method providing the winning move ButtonTileMapping.
  Assert: Assert that the GameOverPlayerWon event is triggered with the right player as the argument.

Validation:
  Verifies that the game correctly identifies a winning move and appropriately ends the game, notifying that the current player has won.

**Scenario 4: Moves Resulting in a Draw**

Details:
  TestName: TestDrawMoveOccupancy
  Description: This test case checks if the game correctly identifies and handles a draw scenario, where all tiles are occupied without a winner.

Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a game scenario such that the next move results in all tiles being filled with no winning line.
  Act: Execute the OccupyTile on the last free tile.
  Assert: Assert that the GameOverDraw event is fired.

Validation:
  Confirm that the method correctly handles a full board without a winner and raises the appropriate draw event, thus ending the game in a draw.

**Scenario 5: Normal Gameplay Switching Players**

Details:
  TestName: TestPlayerSwitchOnNormalMove
  Description: Tests that on a non-winning, non-drawing move, the method switches the turn to the other player.

Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a GameState with an open board where no immediate win or draw is possible.
  Act: Execute OccupyTile on a free tile.
  Assert: Verify that the SwitchPlayer method is called.

Validation:
  This test checks if the flow of the game maintains correctly by switching players after a regular move, maintaining the turn-based nature of gameplay.

These tests provide comprehensive coverage of the main functionality and expected behaviors of the OccupyTile method within the TicTacToe game's logic, testing its response to different game states and ensuring robustness in gameplay handling.
