   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: Test to check if the OccupyTile method behaves correctly when the tile is not occupied

Details:
  TestName: OccupyTileWhenTileIsNotOccupied
  Description: This test will check if the OccupyTile method allows the Player to occupy a tile when it is not already occupied.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Player instance and a GameBoard instance. Choose coordinates 'x' and 'y' for a tile that is not occupied.
  Act: Call the OccupyTile method with the Player instance and the chosen coordinates.
  Assert: Check that the method returns 'true'.
Validation:
  The assertion is verifying that the Player is able to occupy the tile when it is not already occupied. This is the expected behavior according to the game rules.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the OccupyTile method behaves correctly when the tile is already occupied

Details:
  TestName: OccupyTileWhenTileIsAlreadyOccupied
  Description: This test will check if the OccupyTile method prevents the Player from occupying a tile when it is already occupied.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Player instance and a GameBoard instance. Choose coordinates 'x' and 'y' for a tile that is already occupied.
  Act: Call the OccupyTile method with the Player instance and the chosen coordinates.
  Assert: Check that the method returns 'false'.
Validation:
  The assertion is verifying that the Player is not able to occupy the tile when it is already occupied. This is the expected behavior according to the game rules.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the OccupyTile method triggers the PlayerOccupiedTile event correctly

Details:
  TestName: OccupyTileTriggersPlayerOccupiedTileEvent
  Description: This test will check if the OccupyTile method triggers the PlayerOccupiedTile event correctly when a Player occupies a tile.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Player instance and a GameBoard instance. Choose coordinates 'x' and 'y' for a tile that is not occupied. Subscribe to the PlayerOccupiedTile event.
  Act: Call the OccupyTile method with the Player instance and the chosen coordinates.
  Assert: Check that the PlayerOccupiedTile event was triggered and that the event arguments contain the correct Player and coordinates.
Validation:
  The assertion is verifying that the OccupyTile method correctly triggers the PlayerOccupiedTile event with the correct Player and coordinates. This is important for the game mechanics as it allows other parts of the code to react to the event of a Player occupying a tile.

Scenario 4: Test to check if the OccupyTile method behaves correctly with invalid coordinates

Details:
  TestName: OccupyTileWithInvalidCoordinates
  Description: This test will check if the OccupyTile method throws an exception when called with invalid coordinates.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Player instance and a GameBoard instance. Choose coordinates 'x' and 'y' that are outside the valid range for the game board.
  Act: Call the OccupyTile method with the Player instance and the chosen coordinates.
  Assert: Check that the method throws an ArgumentOutOfRangeException.
Validation:
  The assertion is verifying that the OccupyTile method throws an exception when called with invalid coordinates. This is important for preventing errors that could occur if a Player tries to occupy a tile that doesn't exist on the game board.
