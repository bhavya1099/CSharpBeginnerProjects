   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  


Scenario 1: Valid Tile Occupation
Details:
  TestName: ValidTileOccupation
  Description: Verify that a tile can be occupied by a player successfully when the tile is not already occupied.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new Player instance and set up an empty game board.
    Act: Call the OccupyTile method with valid player and tile coordinates.
    Assert: Check that the method returns true indicating successful occupation.
  Validation:
    This test ensures that a player can occupy an empty tile on the game board without any issues.

Scenario 2: Occupied Tile Check
Details:
  TestName: OccupiedTileCheck
  Description: Verify that a tile cannot be occupied if it is already occupied by another player.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Occupy a tile with a player to make it occupied.
    Act: Attempt to occupy the same tile with another player.
    Assert: Verify that the method returns false to indicate the tile is already occupied.
  Validation:
    This test guarantees that the method correctly prevents players from occupying an already taken tile.

Scenario 3: PlayerOccupiedTile Event Invocation
Details:
  TestName: PlayerOccupiedTileEventInvocation
  Description: Ensure that the PlayerOccupiedTile event is correctly triggered when a player occupies a tile.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Subscribe to the PlayerOccupiedTile event.
    Act: Occupy a tile with a player.
    Assert: Confirm that the event is raised with the correct player and tile coordinates.
  Validation:
    This test validates that the event handling mechanism for player tile occupation is functioning as expected.

Scenario 4: Boundary Tile Occupation
Details:
  TestName: BoundaryTileOccupation
  Description: Test occupying a tile at the boundary of the game board.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new Player instance and set up an empty game board.
    Act: Occupy a tile at the edge of the board.
    Assert: Ensure that the method returns true for successful occupation.
  Validation:
    This scenario validates the method's ability to handle tile occupation at the boundaries of the game board.

Scenario 5: Invalid Tile Coordinates
Details:
  TestName: InvalidTileCoordinates
  Description: Test occupying a tile with invalid coordinates outside the board dimensions.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new Player instance and set up an empty game board.
    Act: Try to occupy a tile with coordinates outside the valid range.
    Assert: Verify that the method returns false for invalid tile coordinates.
  Validation:
    This test ensures that the method correctly handles invalid tile coordinates and prevents out-of-bounds access.
