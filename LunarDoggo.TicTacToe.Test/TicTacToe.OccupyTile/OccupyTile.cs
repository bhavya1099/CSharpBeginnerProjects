   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: Occupying an empty tile
Details:
  TestName: OccupyEmptyTile
  Description: Verify that when an empty tile is occupied by a player, the tile is marked with the player's ID and the PlayerOccupiedTile event is raised.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the GameBoard class and a player object.
  Act: Call the OccupyTile method of the GameBoard instance with the player and the coordinates of an empty tile.
  Assert: Verify that the tile at the specified coordinates is marked with the player's ID and that the PlayerOccupiedTile event is raised.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the OccupyTile method correctly updates the game board and raises the PlayerOccupiedTile event when an empty tile is occupied by a player.

Scenario 2: Occupying an already occupied tile
Details:
  TestName: OccupyOccupiedTile
  Description: Verify that when an already occupied tile is attempted to be occupied by a player, the method returns false and the tile is not updated.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the GameBoard class and a player object. Occupy a tile at the specified coordinates.
  Act: Call the OccupyTile method of the GameBoard instance with the player and the coordinates of the occupied tile.
  Assert: Verify that the method returns false and the tile at the specified coordinates is not updated.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the OccupyTile method correctly handles the case when a player attempts to occupy an already occupied tile and returns false without updating the tile.

Scenario 3: Occupying a tile outside the board boundaries
Details:
  TestName: OccupyTileOutsideBoundaries
  Description: Verify that when a player attempts to occupy a tile outside the boundaries of the game board, the method returns false and the tile is not updated.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the GameBoard class and a player object.
  Act: Call the OccupyTile method of the GameBoard instance with the player and coordinates outside the boundaries of the game board.
  Assert: Verify that the method returns false and no tile on the game board is updated.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the OccupyTile method correctly handles the case when a player attempts to occupy a tile outside the boundaries of the game board and returns false without updating any tile.

Scenario 4: Occupying all tiles on the board
Details:
  TestName: OccupyAllTiles
  Description: Verify that when a player occupies all tiles on the game board, the method returns true and the game board is marked as all fields occupied.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the GameBoard class and a player object. Occupy all tiles on the game board except one.
  Act: Call the OccupyTile method of the GameBoard instance with the player and the coordinates of the remaining empty tile.
  Assert: Verify that the method returns true and the game board is marked as all fields occupied.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the OccupyTile method correctly handles the case when a player occupies the last remaining empty tile on the game board and returns true, marking the game board as all fields occupied.

Scenario 5: Occupying a tile triggering a win condition
Details:
  TestName: OccupyTileWinCondition
  Description: Verify that when a player occupies a tile that triggers a win condition, the method returns true and the game board is marked as having a winning player.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the GameBoard class and a player object. Occupy tiles on the game board that will trigger a win condition for the player.
  Act: Call the OccupyTile method of the GameBoard instance with the player and the coordinates of the tile that triggers the win condition.
  Assert: Verify that the method returns true and the game board is marked as having a winning player.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the OccupyTile method correctly handles the case when a player occupies a tile that triggers a win condition and returns true, marking the game board as having a winning player.
