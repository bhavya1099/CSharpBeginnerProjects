   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: All Fields Are Unoccupied

Details:
  TestName: TestAllFieldsUnoccupiedReturnsFalse
  Description: The test should verify that AreAllFieldsOccupied returns false when all tiles on the game board are unoccupied (i.e., all tile values are 0).
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a new GameBoard and ensure no tiles are occupied.
  Act: Call the AreAllFieldsOccupied method.
  Assert: Verify that the method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms the method's correctness in detecting that the board is not fully occupied. It's significant for resolving game states, particularly to prevent false game end deductions.

Scenario 2: One Field Unoccupied

Details:
  TestName: TestOneFieldUnoccupiedReturnsFalse
  Description: This test should check that AreAllFieldsOccupied returns false when at least one tile on the game board is not occupied.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a GameBoard with all but one tile occupied.
  Act: Invoke the AreAllFieldsOccupied method.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation:
  This test ensures the method correctly identifies incomplete board occupation, pivotal in determining ongoing game status and prompting further player actions.

Scenario 3: All Fields Occupied

Details:
  TestName: TestAllFieldsOccupiedReturnsTrue
  Description: The test checks that the method AreAllFieldsOccupied correctly returns true when every tile on the game board is occupied.
Execution:
  Arrange: Configure the GameBoard such that all tiles are occupied.
  Act: Call the AreAllFieldsOccupied method.
  Assert: Confirm that the method returns true.
Validation:
  Validates the method's capability to correctly recognize a fully occupied board, a critical end-game condition that may result in a draw.

Scenario 4: Occupation Post Reset

Details:
  TestName: TestOccupationPostBoardReset
  Description: Test to verify that after resetting the board, the AreAllFieldsOccupied method correctly returns false, confirming no tiles are occupied post-reset.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a GameBoard, occupy some tiles, and then reset the board.
  Act: Invoke the AreAllFieldsOccupied method post reset.
  Assert: Check that the result is false.
Validation:
  This confirms that the GameBoard reset function works correctly by clearing all occupancies and that AreAllFieldsOccupied accurately reflects this reset state. Itâ€™s crucial for game replayability and proper state initialization.

Scenario 5: Partial Occupation Does Not Affect Remaining Tiles

Details:
  TestName: TestPartialOccupationDoesNotAlterRemainingTiles
  Description: Ensure that occupying some tiles does not unintentionally mark unoccupied ones as occupied, thus AreAllFieldsOccupied should return false.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a GameBoard, only occupy a few tiles without completing the whole board.
  Act: Call AreAllFieldsOccupied method.
  Assert: Validate that the method returns false.
Validation:
  Assures that partial occupation scenarios are handled correctly without false positives, maintaining the integrity of game progression logic. This is vital for correct game flow and rule enforcement.
