   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: All Fields Are Unoccupied

Details:
  TestName: TestAllFieldsUnoccupiedReturnsFalse
  Description: The test should verify that AreAllFieldsOccupied returns false when all tiles on the game board are unoccupied (i.e., all tile values are 0).
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a new GameBoard and ensure all tiles are reset to 0.
  Act: Invoke the AreAllFieldsOccupied method on the GameBoard instance.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation:
  Ensure that the method correctly identifies when no tiles have been occupied. This is essential for determining if the game can continue or if further actions are possible on the board.

Scenario 2: All Fields Are Occupied

Details:
  TestName: TestAllFieldsOccupiedReturnsTrue
  Description: Tests whether AreAllFieldsOccupied returns true when every tile on the game board is occupied.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new GameBoard and simulate a condition where all tiles are occupied by setting all entries to a non-zero value.
  Act: Call AreAllFieldsOccupied.
  Assert: Check that the method returns true.
Validation:
  This scenario is vital for checking if the game has reached a state where no further moves are possible, indicating a potential end of game or draw situation.

Scenario 3: Some Fields Are Not Occupied

Details:
  TestName: TestSomeFieldsNotOccupiedReturnsFalse
  Description: Verify that AreAllFieldsOccupied returns false when some tiles are occupied and others are not.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a GameBoard, filling some, but not all, tiles with a non-zero value.
  Act: Execute AreAllFieldsOccupied method.
  Assert: The returned value should be false.
Validation:
  This test confirms the methodâ€™s ability to accurately report incomplete board occupation. This helps in determining if the game should proceed and is crucial for gameplay logic to function correctly.

Scenario 4: First Row Unoccupied, Others Occupied

Details:
  TestName: TestFirstRowUnoccupiedRestOccupiedReturnsFalse
  Description: Ensures that the AreAllFieldsOccupied method returns false if the first row is completely unoccupied but all other tiles are.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize GameBoard with the first row tiles set to 0 and other rows occupied.
  Act: Invoke AreAllFieldsOccupied.
  Assert: Check for a false result.
Validation:
  This test substantiates the method's thoroughness in scanning each row independently, which is integral for situations where occupation may be row-specific due to game strategies.

Scenario 5: Exception Handling On Invalid Tile Index Access

Details:
  TestName: TestExceptionHandlingForInvalidTileIndexAccess
  Description: Tests the robustness of the AreAllFieldsOccupied method when trying to access tiles outside of the valid index range.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock or manipulate the tile array within GameBoard to simulate an IndexError when accessed.
  Act: Execute AreAllFieldsOccupied under this condition.
  Assert: Expect an appropriate exception handling mechanism; method should not crash.
Validation:
  Checks the durability and error handling of the AreAllFieldsOccupied method under faulty conditions, ensuring the method is resilient and safe from common anomalies like index errors. This is important for maintaining stability and reliability of the game application.
