   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: Verify Board Reset Successful

Details:
  TestName: BoardResetSuccessfully
  Description: Test to verify if the Reset method successfully clears all tiles on the game board by setting each cell to 0.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the GameBoard and call the OccupyTile method to fill some tiles.
  Act: Call the Reset method on the instance of the GameBoard.
  Assert: Verify that each tile in the tiles array is set to 0.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result.
  This test ensures that the Reset method correctly sets all values in the tiles array to 0, essential for starting a new game or resetting the board state.

Scenario 2: Verify Board Reset on Fully Occupied Board

Details:
  TestName: BoardResetOnFullyOccupiedBoard
  Description: Test the Reset method's functionality when the game board is fully occupied.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the GameBoard and use OccupyTile to fill all positions with non-zero values.
  Act: Invoke the Reset method.
  Assert: Check that all values in the board are reset to 0.
Validation:
  This test checks the robustness of the Reset method, ensuring it can handle and correctly reset a fully occupied board. This situation could reflect the end of a game needing a reset to start a new one.

Scenario 3: Reset Board With No Initial Occupation

Details:
  TestName: ResetEmptyBoard
  Description: Check if the Reset method maintains the board state if no tiles were previously occupied.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a new GameBoard without modifying the tiles.
  Act: Call the Reset method on this new game board.
  Assert: Ensure all tiles still contain the value 0.
Validation:
  The test confirms that Reset does not erroneously modify tiles of an unused board, affirming the method's correctness and stability in all scenarios. This scenario verifies the no-operation effect on a clean slate board.

Scenario 4: Reset Method Invocation Post-Game Event

Details:
  TestName: ResetAfterGameEvents
  Description: Verify if the Reset method can still function correctly after a sequence of game events like player moves and wins.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a GameBoard, perform a series of OccupyTile calls simulating a game, and trigger some events.
  Act: Call the Reset method afterward.
  Assert: Check the tiles array for all zeros.
Validation:
  This test ensures Reset functionality is intact even after complex game scenarios involving events, ensuring reliability across game sessions.

Scenario 5: Concurrent Calls to Reset

Details:
  TestName: ConcurrentResetCalls
  Description: Ensure the Reset method performs correctly when called multiple times in quick succession.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a GameBoard instance and occupy a few tiles.
  Act: Call the Reset method multiple times.
  Assert: Assure each tile in the tiles matrix is 0.
Validation:
  Ensuring the method's idempotence and resilience against rapid consecutive invocations is crucial for scenarios where multiple reset events might be unintentionally triggered in a short time. This ensures that users or system actions causing rapid calls do not corrupt the game state.
