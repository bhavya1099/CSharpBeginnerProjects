   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: Player Wins By Completing A Row

Details:
  TestName: TestHasWonWithCompleteRow
  Description: Tests if the HasWon method returns true when a player has all their markers in a single row.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the game board and occupy all tiles in a row with the same player's ID.
  Act: Call the HasWon method for the player.
  Assert: Check if the method returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion validates that the HasWon method accurately detects a winning condition when a player occupies all slots in any single row. This is significant as it confirms the game's ability to correctly identify a winner based on standard Tic TacToe rules.

Scenario 2: Player Wins By Completing A Column

Details:
  TestName: TestHasWonWithCompleteColumn
  Description: Tests if the HasWon method returns true when a player has all their markers in a single column.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the game board and occupy all tiles in a column with the same player's ID.
  Act: Call the HasWon method for the player.
  Assert: Check if the method returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion checks for correct identification of a vertical win. This scenario ensures that the game can correctly rule a win when a player manages to align their markers vertically according to Tic TacToe gameplay rules.

Scenario 3: Player Wins By Completing A Diagonal

Details:
  TestName: TestHasWonWithCompleteDiagonal
  Description: Tests if the HasWon method returns true when a player has all their markers across either diagonal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the game board and occupy all tiles in one diagonal with the same player's ID.
  Act: Call the HasWon method for the player.
  Assert: Check if the method returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the diagonal win condition is handled correctly. Winning through diagonal alignment is crucial for the completeness of game rules in Tic TacToe.

Scenario 4: Game Continues With No Complete Row, Column, Or Diagonal

Details:
  TestName: TestHasWonWithIncompleteLines
  Description: Ensure that the HasWon method returns false when no complete row, column, or diagonal is occupied by a single player.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the game board with a configuration where no complete line is occupied by a single player.
  Act: Call the HasWon method for a player.
  Assert: Check if the method returns false.
Validation:
  The test checks that the HasWon method does not falsely declare a win. This is essential for the proper functioning of the game, ensuring fair play by validating ongoing game status correctly.

Scenario 5: Initial Board State Without Any Moves

Details:
  TestName: TestHasWonInitiallyEmptyBoard
  Description: Tests if the HasWon method returns false at the start of the game when the board is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the game board without any moves made.
  Act: Call the HasWon method for any player.
  Assert: Assert that the output is false.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the game begins without any erroneous winner declaration, which maintains the integrity of game rules from the start.

These scenarios collectively ensure that the TicTacToe game's logic for declaring a win or continuing the play is robust and adheres closely to the traditional gameplay rules.
